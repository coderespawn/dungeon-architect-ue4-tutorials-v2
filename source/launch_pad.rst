   Dungeon Architect - List of Builders


Dungeon Architect supports many different types of dungeon layout methods and is designed in a way that new layout methods can be easily added in the future

These layout methods are called `Dungeon Builders` or **Builders** in short

This section lets you create a new scene preconfigured with one of the builder templates.  Click on any of the builders. In the next screen, click the ``Clone Scene`` button

This will create a new scene based on the template, fully configured with the appropriate dungeon.  It will also clone a starting theme file (and any other flow graph assets) and set everything up.  



Choose a folder to saved your scene file.  Once saved, the launcher would do the following:

* Open the new scene
* Open any theme editor windows associated with the referenced assets (Theme Editor, Flow Graph Editors etc)
* Select the dungeon game object (so you see the properties in the inspector by default)



Samples
-------

There are tons of samples to explore.  Select a sample you like and perform one of the following actions

* **Open Scene**: Opens the sample scene (usually under DungeonArchitect_Samples folder)
* **Open Folder**: Opens the folder containing the scene
* **Clone Scene**: Clone a scene and also clone over the referenced assets (themes, flow graphs etc) so you can modify them without affecting the sample scene
* **Watch Demo**: Watch a video, if it exists
