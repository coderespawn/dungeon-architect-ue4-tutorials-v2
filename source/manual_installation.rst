Manual Installation
===================

Manual Installation: If you have purchased your copy of Dungeon Architect from Code Respawn, you can download the latest build at any time and install it into your project with the following steps

* In your game’s root directory, create a folder named Plugins
* Copy the DungeonArchitect folder found in this archive under Plugin/4.X/ into your game’s plugin folder (which was created in step 1). For example, in the ShooterGame sample demo, the directory structure should look like this:
    .. image:: /images/tutorial/X/install_step1.png
	
* Restart the Unreal Editor (if already open) and verify that Dungeon Architect is enabled by navigating to Window Menu > Plugins

* Confirm that Dungeon Architect is visible and enabled
